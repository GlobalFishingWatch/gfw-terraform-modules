This repository serves as the central hub for shared, reusable Terraform modules used across Global Fishing Watch's infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform.

## üöÄ Purpose

Our goal is to foster **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** best practices by providing:

* **Consistency:** Standardized, opinionated ways to provision common infrastructure components.
* **Reusability:** Avoid duplicating code across different projects and teams, leading to faster development cycles.
* **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and update infrastructure definitions from a single, trusted source.
* **Reliability:** Modules are designed with best practices, tested, and validated for consistent behavior.

Each module within this repository is a self-contained, well-documented building block, promoting a modular approach to infrastructure management.

## üì¶ Repository Structure

The core of this repository is the `modules/` directory, which contains individual, independent Terraform modules.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use These Modules

To incorporate a module from this repository into your Terraform configuration, reference it using its Git URL. It is **highly recommended** to pin modules to a specific Git tag (version) to ensure consistent and reproducible deployments.

**Example Usage:**

```terraform
module "cloudbuild_trigger_main_branch" {
  # --- Module Source: Reference your shared repository and the specific module path ---
  source  = "git::https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gfw-terraform-modules.git//modules/cloudbuild-trigger?ref=v0.1.0"

  # --- Put here the specific variables of the module ---
  ... 
}
```

## ü§ñ Makefile Commands

This repository includes a `Makefile` to simplify common Terraform development and maintenance tasks.

### Displaying Available Commands

To see a list of all available commands and their descriptions, run:

```bash
make help
```

You should get an output like:
```bash
check               Check terraform format recursively.
format              Auto-format terraform files recursively.
help                Display this message
```
